# foundry-vtt-dnd5e-types
A community effort to create type definitions for the dnd5e system in Foundry VTT

## Objective

Provide a third party typescript definition library which can be installed and used alongside [foundry-vtt-types](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundry-vtt-types) to bring typescript support to dnd5e related modules.
